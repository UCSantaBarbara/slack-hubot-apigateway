# Admin Role list

This file contains the list of Slack User IDs to be assigned the Apigee admin role within the UCSBTech Slack Community. **If you make changes to this file, you must update the HUBOT_AUTH_ADMIN environmental variable for it to take effect.**

# Source control

This file should be checked in to source control and should be considered authoritative. We check this into source control because this file is used to update the HUBOT_AUTH_ADMIN environmental variable on Heroku.

# Warning

Slack User IDs do not span across all Slack communities. If you are part of a different Slack community, you will have a different
Slack ID for that community even if you use the same username and email address.
